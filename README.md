# M/S Echo-ttage

M/S Echo-ttage is a Mid/Side processing unit that features stereo widening and independent filter and variable-time delay through LFO capabilities per channel.

This allows for seamless transitions between different popular DSP algorithms - from a simple delay to a flanger, phaser, chorus or extreme feedback soundscapes -, and everything in between, performed independently to the Mid or Side channels. This is performed through the use of an LFO per channel that modulates the delay time of the fractional delay.
