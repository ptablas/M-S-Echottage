# M/S Echo-ttage

M/S Echo-ttage is a Mid/Side processing unit that features stereo widening and independent filter and variable-time delay through LFO capabilities per channel.

This allows for seamless transitions between different popular DSP algorithms - from a simple delay to a flanger, phaser, chorus or extreme feedback soundscapes -, and everything in between, performed independently to the Mid or Side channels. This is performed through the use of an LFO per channel that modulates the delay time of the fractional delay.

# Acknowledgments

All the code pertainign to the "Osc" class used for the LFOs is heavily based on the set of lectures *C++ Real-Time Audio Programming with Bela* by Andrew McPherson.

# Libraries

The JUCE library was extensively used for this project, which allowed for very quick GUI design and the use of already-made delay and filter classes.
